# Hello-World-
Clearly there are a lot of options.  And there are already a lot of good answers here.  Also, it's important to note that the question is very vague.  You could probably write a book that would cover all of the possible scenarios that you might face.

Normally I avoid answering overly vague questions, but I do think I have something to add here.  REST is generally a good way to communicate back and forth between a mobile and a server, since it is widely available and understood, easy to implement, easy to debug and is not horribly verbose.  But the real question is, what's the best way to accomplish that on the server.
